# 🚀 SpaceX Falcon 9 First Stage Landing Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is part of the **IBM Data Science Capstone Project**.  
It analyzes the **SpaceX Falcon 9 launch data** to determine the factors influencing successful landings of the rocket’s first stage and builds a **predictive model** to estimate landing outcomes.  
Such predictions are valuable for reducing launch costs and improving mission planning.

## 🚀 Workflow
1. **Data Collection & Wrangling**  
   - Extracted SpaceX launch records from the API and Wikipedia  
   - Cleaned and prepared data for analysis  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Visualized launch success rates by site, booster type, and payload  
   - Conducted correlation analysis between features and landing success  

3. **Data Visualization & Dashboards**  
   - Built interactive visualizations using Plotly and Folium maps  
   - Created a dashboard for stakeholders  

4. **Predictive Modeling**  
   - Applied classification models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, SVM, KNN)  
   - Tuned models and compared performance metrics
